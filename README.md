python discord/twitch API bot

This is a work in progress.  
Pictures, videos and documentation will be added in time.  
I use this bot to give a LIVE role, on my discord server, to anyone who is going live on twitch.tv.  
If I go live on twitch, it also post a "going live now on twitch" comment in a specific discord channel.  

There's some placeholder !ping and !hello commands for future updates.  
Major refactoring will be needed to make this look any good.  
My apologies for the mess.  

Here's an example of a post made in a discord channel when someone from the watchlist goes live.
