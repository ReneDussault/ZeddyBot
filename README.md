# ZeddyBot
WIP python discord/twitch API bot

This is a work in progress. Pictures, videos and documentation will be added in time.
I use this bot to give a LIVE role to anyone who is going live on twitch.tv.
If I go live on twitch, it also post a "going live now on twitch" comment in a specific discord channel.

There's some placeholder !ping and !hello commands for future updates.
Major refactoring will be needed to make this look any good.
My apologies for the mess.
