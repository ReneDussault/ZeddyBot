# Real-time Discord Stats & Improved Token Management

## Changes Made

### 1. Real-time Discord Stats Updates

**Problem**: Discord member counts were only updating every 30 seconds via polling, causing delays in dashboard statistics.

**Solution**: Implemented real-time event-driven updates using Discord.py events:

#### New Features in `zeddybot.py`:
- Added `update_discord_stats()` method that caches member statistics
- Integrated with Discord events for instant updates:
  - `on_member_join` - Updates stats when someone joins
  - `on_member_remove` - Updates stats when someone leaves  
  - `on_member_update` - Updates stats when online status changes
  - `on_presence_update` - Updates stats when presence changes
- Added stats initialization in `on_ready()` event
- Enhanced API endpoint to use cached real-time data with fallback

#### Benefits:
- **Instant Updates**: Dashboard now shows accurate member counts immediately
- **Reduced API Calls**: Stats are cached and updated only when needed
- **Better Performance**: No more polling every 30 seconds
- **Real-time Accuracy**: Member counts reflect actual server state

### 2. Shared Token Management System

**Problem**: Dashboard had authentication failures with "Login authentication failed" errors and couldn't properly refresh Twitch bot tokens.

**Solution**: Created shared token utility system and improved authentication logic:

#### New File: `token_utils.py`
- `refresh_twitch_bot_token()` - Centralized token refresh logic
- `validate_bot_token()` - Test if tokens are still valid
- `get_current_bot_token()` - Safely retrieve current token
- Proper error handling and logging
- Automatic config file updates

#### Enhanced Authentication in `dashboardqa.py`:
- Token validation before use
- Automatic refresh on authentication failures
- Better error messages and debugging
- Shared logic with Discord bot
- Real authentication response checking

#### Benefits:
- **Reliable Chat Sending**: Dashboard can now send messages consistently
- **Automatic Recovery**: Invalid tokens are auto-refreshed
- **Shared Logic**: Both bot and dashboard use same token management
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear messages about authentication issues

## Usage Instructions

### For Real-time Stats:
1. Start Discord bot: `python zeddybot.py`
2. Start dashboard: `python dashboardqa.py`
3. Member counts now update instantly when people join/leave/change status

### For Chat Sending:
1. Dashboard will automatically validate and refresh tokens as needed
2. No more "Login authentication failed" errors
3. Clear error messages if token refresh fails
4. Shared token management between bot and dashboard

## Technical Details

### Discord Stats Caching:
```python
# Stats are cached in bot._discord_stats and updated on events:
{
    'total_members': 17,
    'total_humans': 15, 
    'online_members': 8,
    'bot_connected': True,
    'guild_name': 'Your Server',
    'last_updated': '2025-01-21T...'
}
```

### Token Management Flow:
1. Check if token exists
2. Validate token with Twitch API
3. If invalid, automatically refresh using refresh token
4. Update config file with new tokens
5. Retry operation with fresh token

### Performance Improvements:
- **Before**: Fixed 30-second polling for Discord stats
- **After**: Event-driven real-time updates
- **Before**: Manual token refresh on failures
- **After**: Automatic validation and refresh

## Files Modified:
- `zeddybot.py` - Added real-time stats updates and shared token utility
- `dashboardqa.py` - Improved chat authentication and shared token utility  
- `token_utils.py` - New shared token management utility

All improvements maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving reliability and performance.
